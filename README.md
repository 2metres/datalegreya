##the typeface that melts text and data visualisation

>Datalegreya is a typeface which can interweave data curves with text. It is designed by Figs, on the basis of open source font Alegreya Sans SC Thin by typographer Juan Pablo del Peral. 

>Datalegreya can be used in all contexts where small space is available to synthetically display graphical data: connected objects, embedded displays, annual reports, weather report, stock prices, etc.
>It doesn’t need any specialized software: users just have to install it in the operating system and launch any software able to display OpenType fonts, such as Microsoft Word, Apple TextEdit, Adobe Suite etc. 
>Standards compliance makes it equally available on the web or software embedded.>Most connected objects feature a small sized screen, and all of them are about data. By its hybrid design aimedto displaying text and data in compact spaces, Datalegreya brings a realistic and elegant solution to this ever growing market’s specific issues.

##how to use it ?
To use it, one just have to insert after each letter a special character followed by a number. The font automatically replaces this simple code by the signs that will display the curve corresponding to the selected values.Under the hood, Datalegreya makes use of OpenType advanced features: multiple substitutions grant the possibility to replace several signs by one unique character.

====###Simplest form
Datalegreya can be used like a standard font. Its design is  nearly the same than Alegreya Sans Small Caps Thin.
